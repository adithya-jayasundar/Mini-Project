# Research Paper Recommendation Frontend

This is a modern React (Vite) frontend inspired by Consensus AI, featuring:
- Personalized research paper recommendation feed
- Search bar for research papers
- Chat with the paper using LLM

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/components/Feed.jsx` – Recommendation feed
- `src/components/SearchBar.jsx` – Search bar
- `src/components/ChatWithPaper.jsx` – Chat interface for papers

## Customization
Replace placeholder components with your actual logic and connect to your backend/LLM as needed.
